## Sandcastle
Sandcastle is a project to show moderne technologies:
- Microfrontend
- Microservices
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Even more...

## Repositories
[See all repositories](https://github.com/orgs/UtopikSandcastle/repositories)

## Microfrontends
Microfrontends are an architectural style where a frontend application is decomposed into individual, semi-independent "micro-apps" working loosely together. This concept is similar to microservices architecture in backend development, but applied to frontend web development. The idea is to break down a web application into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

Every Sandcastle's microfrontend has it's own repository. Their repository name ending by "frontend" and could be found here: [UtopikSandcastle's repositories](https://github.com/orgs/UtopikSandcastle/repositories).

## Microservices
Microservices is an architectural style and approach to software development where a large application is built as a suite of modular services. Each service is scoped around a specific business goal and can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently. This approach is in contrast to traditional monolithic architectures where an application is built as a single, indivisible unit.

Every Sandcastle's microservice has it's own repository. Their repository name ending by "api" and could be found here: [UtopikSandcastle's repositories](https://github.com/orgs/UtopikSandcastle/repositories).

## Event-Driven Architecture
Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern in which decoupled applications or services can asynchronously communicate and react to events. This architecture is particularly suited to environments where events (or changes in state) occur frequently and systems need to respond to them in real-time or near real-time.

Some Sandcastle's microservice react to event to process particular action. For example: on security alert, some staff may have to protect the service they have on charge.
