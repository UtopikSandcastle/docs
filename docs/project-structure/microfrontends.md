# Microfrontends

## Microfrontend with Angular
This project uses ANGULARarchitects' Module Federation package, a tool specifically designed for Angular, a widely-used web application framework. Module Federation introduces the concept of dynamically loading modules (or components) at runtime from various sources, thereby enhancing the microfrontend architecture.
